/*
Used a modified copy of the Select form from above. How to do this: 
> Export the customerSelect form (under File > Export Form), and import it back into the same project (under Project > Import Existing Form). The form will have a .frm file extension.
> Rename the new form customerDelete
> Rename any controls to be what you want.
> Remember, you cannot use the first line of event listeners that were on an imported form because appStudio only registers a new event handler when it is initially created by right-clicking on the control. So the imported one, having been already created, is not registered with the new form and has to be re-created so it will be registered.
    - copy the code in the event  handler you want to redo
     - delete the entire event handler code.  
     - create a new event listener by right-clicking on the control and picking an event. 
     - paste the code you copied into the new event handler
     - change the names of local variables and controls inside the event handler to match any names that you changed. 
Used a textArea  or Dropdown that shows all the customer names, one per line.
User can pick a customer from the list.  
Used a sql Delete  query to delete the customer chosen by the user from the display control. 
Used an AJAX call to the database to delete the matching customer. 
Checked if customer name exists in database before deleting it.
Used a textArea to show the user the remaining customer names, using a template literal.
